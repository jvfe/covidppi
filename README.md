# Visualizing the SARS-CoV-2/Homo sapiens PPI network

This is a project I built to learn basic d3.js. It intends to visualize the SARS-CoV-2/Homo sapiens PPI network, acquired from [BioGRID](https://thebiogrid.org/news/231), as a disjointed force-directed graph.

Check it out [here](https://jvfe.github.io/covidppi/)
